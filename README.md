# partyLines
This is the code for a study I'm undergoing that asks a simple question. When do representatives vote against party lines?
To answer this question I'm analyzing public voting data from Canada, Switzerland, and the USA.

This analysis is broken down into two parts: analysis of party, and analysis of representatives. 
Analysis of party treats every vote as if the vote belonged to the party.
Analysis of representative treats a rep as having a position and a party for every vote.
